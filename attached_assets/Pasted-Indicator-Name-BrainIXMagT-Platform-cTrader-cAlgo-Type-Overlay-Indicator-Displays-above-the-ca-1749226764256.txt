1. Introduction and Purpose of the Indicator
Description:
The BrainIXMagT indicator is an all-in-one tool for detecting intelligent buy and sell signals based on the combination of several internal indicators, including RSI, QQE, ADX/DMS, ATR, moving averages (volume and trend), and more.

The main goal of this indicator is to provide a "Summary Table" at the top of the chart with powerful oscillators and filters. This is achieved by the following methods:

Volume filtering

Trend filtering (Moving Average)

Range Market detection based on ATR

Optimized RSI and QQE calculation for different timeframes

Order Blocks and Fair Value Gaps detection

Trend Dots visualization using three exponential moving averages

Signal strength percentage display based on RSI and ADX combination

The indicator includes several key steps:

QQE calculation using ATR-based delta on Smoothed RSI

Buy/sell signal detection using RSI crossovers with SMA and Overbought/Oversold levels

Volume and trend filters

Market status detection (Range or Trend)

Drawing order blocks and FVGs

Displaying summary table in the top corner of the chart

3. Internal Variables and Indicators
Internal cAlgo Indicators:
_rsi: Relative Strength Index (RSI)

_rsiSma: Simple Moving Average (SMA) on RSI

_rsiMa: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on RSI (for QQE)

_atr: Average True Range (ATR)

_dms: Directional Movement System (ADX, +DI, -DI)

_volumeSma: Simple Moving Average on Volume (Tick Volumes)

_trendMa: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on Close Prices

4. Main Methods and Calculations
4.1 Initialize()
This method initializes all internal indicators required for calculations.

4.2 Calculate(int index)
Calculates the key values for the current bar (candlestick).

4.3 CalculateQQE(int index)
Calculates the QQE values based on ATR and RSI smoothing.

4.4 GetDar(double atrRsi, int index)
Calculates the Average True Range (ATR) for the RSI.

5. How to Use and Run the Indicator
To use the BrainIXMagT indicator in cTrader, load the indicator onto your chart and adjust the input parameters as needed. The summary table will display key information about market conditions, and the buy/sell signals will be displayed on the chart according to the calculated parameters.

Conclusion
The BrainIXMagT is a powerful and customizable indicator that integrates multiple technical analysis tools to provide reliable buy and sell signals. It combines traditional indicators like RSI, QQE, and ADX with advanced features like Order Blocks and Fair Value Gaps to deliver a comprehensive analysis of market conditions.
